For the report in question-3, you are required to mention the average number of operations( number of elements you had to iterate through in order to reach desired key location in the hash table) that you used for Insertion and search (deletion not necessary). You have to note down this observation for 4 different num_of_buckets i.e. 2, 5, 10 and 20. For example, for each input file you can create a 2*4 table where you note down avg search and avg insertion operations taken for given 4 num_of_buckets values. Now from these 10 tables, you have to conclude about, for which num_of_bucket value, you saw a lesser number of operations and why?
Avg insert op = total insert op / num of insert command( in input )
Also while submitting your code on moodle, please remember to change your function and variables to the same format that has been given in the assignment pdf, as there will be an automated evaluation for this problem.
